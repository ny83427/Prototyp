## Prototyp is a JAVA shoot'em up using LWJGL

Only X86 JDK was supported, so use a X86 JDK8 would be fit nowadays, as JDK11 only support X64.
To run the game via `rtype.Prototyp`, you either need to set classpath manually following the
[instructions](http://wiki.lwjgl.org/wiki/Setting_Up_LWJGL_with_Eclipse.html), or add JVM parameters
according to your OS, for example, as a Windows user I just add `-Djava.library.path=native/win32`.

Original author is [fabiensanglard](https://github.com/fabiensanglard) and you can access the repository
at [here](https://github.com/fabiensanglard/Prototyp), as this project was not updated for 7 years, I
made some adjustments to make it work.

Another similar project [myKaruga](http://fabiensanglard.net/neverGiveUp/index.php) is also a good example.
